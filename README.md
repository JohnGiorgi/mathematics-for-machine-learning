# Mathematics for Machine Learning

A single resource, in the form of a simple website built with GitHub Pages, which will hopefully serve as a complete crash course on the various areas of mathematics essential to understanding machine learning. To do this, I will use the [Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) as my guide, but also pull from other resources, such as [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) and [3blue1brown](http://www.3blue1brown.com) various video playlists on Youtube. 

The website can be accessed [here](https://johngiorgi.github.io/mathematics-for-machine-learning/).
