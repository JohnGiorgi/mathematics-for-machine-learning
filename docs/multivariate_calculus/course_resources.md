# Course resources

There are lots of useful web resources on **multivariate calculus**. Typically they go a bit slower or have a different emphasis or way of explaining things, but it can be handy to see how someone else explains something.

- **Khan Academy** is a great resource right up to 1st or 2nd year undergraduate material. For this course, there's a handy group of videos [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus).
- **Grant Sanderson** has a great series of videos developing mathematical intuition on YouTube, which you can reach through his site [here](http://www.3Blue1Brown.com).
