# Course resources

There are lots of useful web resources on **linear algebra**. Typically they go a bit slower or have a different emphasis or way of explaining things, but it can be handy to see how someone else explains something.

- **Khan Academy** is a great resource right up to 1st or 2nd year undergraduate material. For this course, there's a handy group of videos [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra).
- **Grant Sanderson** has a great series of videos developing mathematical intuition on YouTube, which you can reach through his site [here](http://www.3Blue1Brown.com).
- **Wikipedia** gets better every year - and the [linear algebra wikipedia pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) are actually pretty good.
