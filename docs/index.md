A single resource, in the form of a simple website built with GitHub Pages, which will hopefully serve as a complete crash course on the various areas of mathematics essential to understanding machine learning. To do this, I will use the [Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) as my guide, but also pull from other resources, such as [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) and [3Blue1Brown](http://www.3blue1brown.com)'s various video playlists on Youtube.

The end goal will be to produce a simple site that someone (including myself) could use to quickly bring themselves up to speed on the fundamental mathematical concepts necessary for machine learning. The target audience are those who have at least _some_ highschool math, but who should really have taken introductory courses on Linear Algebra and Calculus in college.

The website can be accessed [here](https://johngiorgi.github.io/mathematics-for-machine-learning/).

Full credit to the team behind the [Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning) course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) for creating such an awesome resource. I highly encourage anyone who needs to brush up on their mathematics for machine learning to check that course out.

## Notebooks

[Notebooks](notebooks) contains [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) notebooks for each course in the [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning), which each contain `python` implementations for many of the discussed concepts.
